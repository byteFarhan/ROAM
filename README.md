## Features of this project

🚀 I've implemented an authentication system using Firebase, enabling users to register and log in to their accounts securely.

🚀 Additionally, I've incorporated the functionality for users to log in with their other social accounts, such as Google and GitHub.

🚀 Furthermore, I've implemented a private route concept to restrict access to specific routes unless users are logged in to their accounts, ensuring enhanced security and privacy.

🚀 On the homepage, I've showcased some tourist spots loaded from a MongoDB database.

🚀 I've added routes for adding and updating tourist spots, providing users with the ability to contribute to the database and keep information up-to-date.

🚀 I've implemented a route for each tourist spot displayed, allowing users to access comprehensive information about a specific spot when they click the "View Details" button.

🚀 Within the spot details route, users can find detailed information about the specific tourist spot.

🚀 Additionally, I've introduced a route named 'My List' where users can view the spots they have added in tabular form. They also have the option to delete any spots they have added to their list, offering a seamless user experience.
